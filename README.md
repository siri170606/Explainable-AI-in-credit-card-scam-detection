# Explainable AI in Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP and LIME to enhance the transparency of credit card fraud detection. We applied these methods to eight machine learning models using the Kaggle dataset: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Key Contributions
1. Compared eight ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Naïve Bayes, KNN, and Neural Network using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. Enhanced the SHAP and LIME for global and local explanations with pre-processing than traditional applications. 
3. Visualized explanation patterns with density analysis and box plots.
4. Developed a transparent fraud detection framework using LIME and SHAP. 
5. Insights across models and comments based on experiments and conclusions on the applications of the explainable methods.
